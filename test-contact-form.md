# 🧪 Contact Form Testing Guide (EmailJS)

## 🎯 **Test Your EmailJS Contact Form**

### **Step 1: Check Current Status**
1. Open your portfolio in the browser
2. Go to the Contact section
3. Look for the configuration status indicator:
   - **Yellow warning box** = EmailJS not loaded yet (wait a moment)
   - **No warning box** = EmailJS is loaded and working

### **Step 2: Test Form Validation**
1. Try to submit the form with empty fields
2. Try to submit with invalid email format
3. **Expected result**: Form should show validation errors

### **Step 3: Test EmailJS Functionality**
1. Fill out the form with valid data:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Message: "This is a test message from EmailJS"
2. Click "Send Message" (should say "Send Message")
3. **Expected result**: 
   - Form should submit without opening email client
   - Success toast should appear: "Message sent successfully! 🎉"
   - Form should reset
   - Check your Gmail inbox (mashmovie58@gmail.com)

### **Step 4: Test Fallback System**
1. If EmailJS fails for any reason, the form will automatically fall back to opening your email client
2. **Expected result**: Email client opens with pre-filled message

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

### **Check Browser Console**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit the form
4. Look for these log messages:
   ```
   📧 Sending message: {name: "...", email: "...", message: "..."}
   📧 Email result: {success: true, method: "EmailJS"}
   ```

### **Check Network Tab**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Submit the form
4. Look for requests to EmailJS service

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "EmailJS Not Loaded" warning**
**Solutions:**
1. **Wait a moment** - EmailJS takes a few seconds to load
2. **Refresh the page** - EmailJS script needs to initialize
